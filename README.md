Meme Generator: Unleash Your Inner Meme Lord 😎✨
Welcome to the Meme Generator, a web app that turns your boring images into epic memes with custom text, aesthetic emojis, and snazzy fonts. Built by a 2nd-year IT student who codes by day and memes by night, this project is your ticket to creating viral-worthy masterpieces. 🚀
Why This Project Exists
Because life’s too short for bad memes! This app lets you:

Upload any image (cute cats, grumpy coders, you name it).
Slap on top and bottom text in ALL CAPS (because memes scream).
Choose from 5 fonts (Impact for the OGs, Lobster for the aesthetic).
Drop aesthetic emojis (✨🌸🦋) anywhere on the canvas with a click.
Download your meme to flex on your friends or confuse your grandma.

Features That Make You Go "LOL"

Image Upload: Drag and drop any image to start your meme journey.
Custom Text: Add top and bottom text, automatically YELLING in uppercase.
Font Fiesta: Pick from Arial, Impact, Roboto, Comic Neue, or Lobster, with a preview in the dropdown (fancy, right?).
Aesthetic Emoji Vibes: Click to place ✨ Sparkles, 🌸 Cherry Blossoms, 🦋 Butterflies, and more for that Instagram glow.
Download Magic: Save your meme as a PNG to share on X or frame it ironically.

How to Use This Meme Machine

Clone this repo (or just stare at it in awe).
Open index.html in a browser (no server needed, it’s that chill).
Upload an image, type some hilarious text (e.g., “WHEN CODE WORKS” / “PURE CHAOS”).
Pick a font from the dropdown (Lobster for that extra vibe).
Select an emoji (like 🧸 Teddy Bear) and click on the canvas to place it.
Hit “Generate Meme” and download your masterpiece.
Post it on X and watch the likes roll in. 😎
